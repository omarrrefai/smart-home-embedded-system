This project was undertaken as a requirement for the embedded systems course at PSUT during the Fall semester of 2023.


In this project, we designed a smart home model to automate and improve both home security and environmental conditions. 
The MCU (PIC16F877A) interacts with several specialized interconnected devices. These devices include a servo motor responsible 
for managing the movable parts of a window shutter. The motor is guided by a light sensor, which activates the shutter to raise 
or lower based on the detected levels of light. The system includes a temperature sensor that operates a fan connected to a DC motor. 
This subsystem monitors and regulates the home's temperature to ensure optimal comfort. The system also showcases security features 
with an Infrared (IR) sensor positioned on the window. This sensor is designed to identify potential intrusions, triggering a buzzer
to alert homeowners of potential security breaches.
